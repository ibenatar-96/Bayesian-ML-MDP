1. run 10 REAL games (10 episodes)
2. look at the logger, if I have enough data (enough actions for a certain parameter) then I should run inference on that parameter
3. Evaluation
    a. Q-Learning
    b. run TEST REAL Games (do not gather info to the log)
4. go to 1...

SAVE THE DATA IN AN EXTERNAL FILE!!

[[s,a,s1,a1,s2,a2,s3,..., until end of episode], [....]]

each element in the array is an episode - an episode in our case is a FULL game, from empty board to terminal state.

# TODO : Change logger to hold sequences of: state, action, next_state
# TODO : Limit it to 15 games! not 15 elements in each array..
